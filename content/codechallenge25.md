Summary: Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! What movies are in theaters now or just came out on your favorite streaming service? What are upcoming movies, when will they be released? Can I keep track of all new humor movies? Or what about that specific actor or director? Having a notification service around movies seems an interesting, fun and useful code challenge to us.

Hi Pythonistas, a new week, a new 'bite' of Python coding! What movies are in theaters now or just came out on your favorite streaming service? What are upcoming movies, when will they be released? Can I keep track of all new humor movies? Or what about that specific actor or director? Having a notification service around movies seems an interesting, fun and useful code challenge to us.

##Â The challenge

* Basic: find a resource that updates with now playing and/or upcoming movies and consume it. Make a simple notification mechanism. We think an email would be best, but you could also try a bot of some kind (Twitter, Slack, ...). You are more into series? That's fine too. You could for example make a notification service around air dates of TV shows.

* Intermediate: add command line switches to the script to filter on things like genre, director, actor, country, rating, streaming service.

* Advanced: make a subscription service web app where the filters are check boxes and subscribers get customized emails based on their stored preferences.

## A few resources

* Google *now playing/upcoming movies/series* and you get a ton of resources. Just a few examples: [Fadango](http://www.fandango.com/moviesintheaters), [Imdb](http://www.imdb.com/movies-coming-soon/), [Rotten tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/upcoming/), etc. For series you could use [airdates.tv](http://www.airdates.tv/) for example.

* If the resource has an API we recommend using it. One nice API for example is [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en). Another open database you could use is [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com/).

* If you want to make a bot, we did a few, just search [our articles](https://pybit.es/archives.html).

## Getting ready

See [our INSTALL doc](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/blob/master/INSTALL.md) how to fork [our challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) to get cracking.

This doc also provides you with instructions how you can submit your code to our community branch via a Pull Request (PR). We will feature your PRs in our end-of-the-week challenge review ([previous editions](http://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html)).

## Feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, please [contact us](http://pybit.es/pages/about.html) or open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
