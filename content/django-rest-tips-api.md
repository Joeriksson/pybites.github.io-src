Summary: In this article I will show you how to build a simple API for our growing collection of Python tips. First we make a simple Django app, defining the model. Next we use Django REST Framework to make an API supporting common CRUD operations. Then we will test it out using curl, Postman and Django REST's browser front-end. Lastly we deploy the API to Digital Ocean so we can start using it via our Slack with a Slash Command, which I will cover in the next article. Sounds exciting? You bet it is! Let's jump straight in!

In this article I will show you how to build a simple API for our growing collection of Python tips:

- First we make a simple Django app, defining the model.
- Next we use Django REST Framework to make an API supporting common CRUD operations.
- Then we will test it out using curl, Postman and Django REST's browser front-end.
- Lastly we deploy the API to Digital Ocean so we can start using it via our Slack with a Slash Command, which I will cover in the next article.

Sounds exciting? You bet it is! Let's jump straight in!

## Setup

_If you want to follow along, the final code is [here](https://github.com/pybites/python_tips)_.

First we make [a virtual environment](https://pybit.es/the-beauty-of-virtualenv.html) and `pip install` [the requirements](https://github.com/pybites/python_tips/blob/master/requirements.txt) which include:

- `django` to build the app,
- `django-rest` to build the API,
- `bs4` (`BeautifulSoup`) and `requests` to parse the existing tips from our platform,
- `psycopg2` and `gunicorn` for deployment on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

So here we go:

	[bobbelderbos@imac code]$ mkdir tips_api && cd $_
	[bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ alias pvenv
	alias pvenv='/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3.7 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate'
	[bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ pvenv
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ python -V
	Python 3.7.0
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ pip install -r requirements.txt
	...

Let's set the following 2 environment variables as referenced in Django's `settings.py` file later on:

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ deactivate
	[bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ vi venv/bin/activate
	...
	export SECRET_KEY='some-secret-string'
	export DEBUG=True

Then activate the venv:

	[bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ source venv/bin/activate
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$

It's also important to set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, but as we will see later I have it default to localhost which is fine for my local env.

## Create a Django project and app

Let's make a Django project in the current directory (`.`):

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ django-admin.py startproject tips .

Ignoring my virtual env folder, Django created this minimalistic project folder structure, _tips_ being our main app:

	$ tree -I venv
	.
	├── manage.py
	├── requirements.txt
	└── tips
		├── __init__.py
		├── settings.py
		├── urls.py
		└── wsgi.py

	1 directory, 6 files

And let's make our api _app_ to keep it isolated from the rest:

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ django-admin.py startapp api
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api]$ tree -I venv
	.
	├── api
	│   ├── __init__.py
	│   ├── admin.py
	│   ├── apps.py
	│   ├── migrations
	│   │   └── __init__.py
	│   ├── models.py
	│   ├── tests.py
	│   └── views.py
	...

Lastly we need to tell Django about both apps in `tips/settings.py` -> `INSTALLED_APPS`. We also add `rest_framework` here for later use:

	INSTALLED_APPS = [
		...
		'rest_framework',
		...
		'tips',
		'api',
	]

### The model

Looking at the original model on our platform we see the following fields:

![design]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/design.png)

As we saw [last time](https://pybit.es/python-tips-carbon-selenium.html) the `share_link` is to be populated by an admin when we share out a tip with a nice [carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) image.

Let's build our model `tips/models.py` using these fields. 

I am also creating an `Author` model to store Twitter and Slack handles from future contributing users. The former to give credit when we share their tips on Twitter, the latter to store the author of the tip when we start receiving them from Slack (next article).

Thinking about (predicting) tomorrow's requirement is one of the fascinating things about software development!

	from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	from django.db import models
	from django.db.models.signals import post_save
	from django.dispatch import receiver


	class Tip(models.Model):
		tip = models.TextField()
		code = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
		link = models.URLField(blank=True, null=True)

		# set by admin
		approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)
		share_link = models.URLField(blank=True, null=True)

		added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		edited = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
		user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)


	class Author(models.Model):
		"""Extending the standard User model:
		https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html
		"""
		user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
		slack_handle = models.CharField(max_length=30, unique=True)
		twitter_handle = models.CharField(max_length=30)


	@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
	def create_user_author(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
		if created:
			Author.objects.create(user=instance)


	@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
	def save_user_author(sender, instance, **kwargs):
		instance.author.save()

The `Tip` model should be pretty straightforward. Note the `User` ForeignKey in `Tip` to give them _owners_.

I added `@receiver`s to Django's native `User` model to detect when a new user gets created. When that happens a new `Author` instance is created as well.

This is one way to extend Django's `User` model which I learned about [here](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/22/how-to-extend-django-user-model.html). 

Now it's time to make the migration files and migrate (sync) the two new models to the database.

As it's the first time we call `migrate` all models that come with Django out of the box, get synced to the DB as well. I am using the default `sqlite3` DB for now, but I should probably change that to Postgres to mirror deployment to Digital Ocean.

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ python manage.py makemigrations tips
	Migrations for 'tips':
	tips/migrations/0001_initial.py
		- Create model Author
		- Create model Tip

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ python manage.py migrate
	Operations to perform:
	Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, tips
	Running migrations:
	Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
	Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
	Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
	Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
	Applying admin.0003_logentry_add_action_flag_choices... OK
	Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
	Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
	Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
	Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
	Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
	Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
	Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
	Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
	Applying auth.0009_alter_user_last_name_max_length... OK
	Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
	Applying tips.0001_initial... OK

Let's create a `superuser` _pybites_ to access the app and see if the `Author` entry was created as well

	$ python manage.py createsuperuser
	Username (leave blank to use 'bobbelderbos'): pybites
	Email address:
	Password:
	Password (again):
	Superuser created successfully.

Great: that created both a `User` and an `Author` instance in our DB. I am using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org) to query my local DB here:

![auth user]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/auth_user.png)

![tips author]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/tips_author.png)

## Import Tips from our Platform

Next we want to retrieve the tips [currently on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/tips) so I coded up a [Django command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/custom-management-commands/) to parse them and save them to our new tips Database. 

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ cd tips/
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips (master)]$ mkdir -p management/commands
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips (master)]$ cd $_
	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac commands (master)]$ vi sync_tips.py

Here is the code I mostly re-used from last week's article: [Generating Beautiful Code Snippets with Carbon and Selenium](https://pybit.es/python-tips-carbon-selenium.html):

	import sys

	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
	import requests

	from django.contrib.auth.models import User
	from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

	from tips.models import Tip

	PYBITES = 'pybites'
	PYBITES_HAS_TWEETED = f'{PYBITES}/status'
	TIPS_PAGE = 'https://codechalleng.es/tips'


	class Command(BaseCommand):
		"""Quick and dirty, using bs4 from last article:
		https://github.com/pybites/blog_code/blob/master/tips/tips.py

		About django-admin commands:
		https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/custom-management-commands/
		"""
		help = 'Script to insert pybites tips from platform'

		def handle(self, *args, **options):
			try:
				user = User.objects.get(username=PYBITES)
			except User.DoesNotExist:
				error = 'Cannot run this without SU pybites'
				sys.exit(error)

			html = requests.get(TIPS_PAGE)
			soup = BeautifulSoup(html.text, 'html.parser')
			trs = soup.findAll("tr")

			new_tips_created = 0
			for tr in trs:
				tds = tr.find_all("td")
				tip_html = tds[1]

				links = tip_html.findAll("a", class_="left")
				first_link = links[0].attrs.get('href')

				pre = tip_html.find("pre")
				code = pre and pre.text or None

				share_link = None
				if PYBITES_HAS_TWEETED in first_link:
					share_link = first_link

				tip = tip_html.find("blockquote").text
				src = len(links) > 1 and links[1].attrs.get('href') or None

				_, created = Tip.objects.get_or_create(tip=tip, code=code,
													   link=src, user=user,
													   approved=True,
													   share_link=share_link)

				if created:
					new_tips_created += 1

			print(f'Done: {new_tips_created} tips imported')

It scrapes the page with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Originally I kept a list of `Tip` objects and used Django's ORM `bulk_create` method to write them to the DB in one transaction which is neat. 

However I found it nicer to make it work like an update script, in case the platform gets new tips in the interim. Calling the script again should just insert the newer tips.

For that reason I went with Django's handy `Tip.objects.get_or_create` which will create the tip if nothing matches the `kwargs` passed in, otherwise it will return the object (which I ignore using `_`). This way it will only create a tip if not already in the DB. 

Let's run this:

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ python manage.py sync_tips
	Done: 92 tips imported

![tips imported]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/import.png)

![a single tip]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/import2.png)

Awesome: we have our tips in the DB and you now know how to write a Django Command! Just extend `BaseCommand`, implement `handle` and save the script in a subdirectory called `management/commands` in your app folder.

## Build an API with Django REST Framework

Let's build the API next. We already added `rest_framework` to `INSTALLED_APPS`. Let's also set the [permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/) to `DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly` which seems to match what we want:

> Similar to `DjangoModelPermissions` (permission class ties into Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` model permissions), but also allows unauthenticated users to have read-only access to the API.

In `tips/settings.py` I am adding the `REST_FRAMEWORK dict`, setting `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES`:

	REST_FRAMEWORK = {
		# Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,
		# or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.
		'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
			'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly'
		]
	}

### Serializers

Next we need a serializer which [Django REST](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/) defines as:

> Serializers allow complex data such as querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content types. Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data.

In `api/serializers.py` I added this code which should look familiar if you have worked with the [Django Form](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/forms/) class:

	from rest_framework import serializers

	from tips.models import Tip


	class TipSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
		author = serializers.RelatedField(read_only=True)

		class Meta:
			model = Tip
			fields = ('tip', 'code', 'link', 'author', 'approved', 'share_link')

You probably don't have to define `fields` if you want them all, but being explicit is usually not a bad thing.

### Views

Next the views. Again Django REST Framework's great level of abstraction saves us a lot of boilerplate code. We can just extend some useful classes defined in `generics`:

	from rest_framework import generics

	from tips.models import Tip
	from .serializers import TipSerializer
	from .permissions import IsOwnerOrReadOnly


	class TipList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
		"""
		get:
		Return a list of all tips in the DB.

		post:
		Create an awesome new tip.
		"""
		queryset = Tip.objects.all()
		serializer_class = TipSerializer


	class TipDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
		"""
		get:
		Return an individual tip.

		put:
		Update an existing tip.

		delete:
		Delete a single tip.
		"""
		permission_classes = (IsOwnerOrReadOnly, )
		queryset = Tip.objects.all()
		serializer_class = TipSerializer

Note that I structured the _docstrings_ in a way to easily add documentation using a tool like [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) in the future.

### Permissions

In the `TipDetail` view we defined a customized _permission class_ called `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` which we need to define next in `api/permissions.py` (code from second example [here](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/#examples)).

The following code in that module will grant read access to any safe methods (`GET`, `OPTIONS` and `HEAD`) and edit right for users that have authored ("own") tips. 

	from rest_framework import permissions


	class IsOwnerOrReadOnly(permissions.BasePermission):
		"""
		Make sure only owners of tips can edit them.
		"""

		def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
			# Read permissions are allowed to any request,
			# so we'll always allow GET, HEAD or OPTIONS requests.
			if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
				return True

			# Instance must have an attribute named `owner`.
			return obj.user == request.user

`obj.user` refers to the `ForeignKey` we defined on the `Tip` model:

	class Tip(models.Model):
		...
		user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

### Routes

And finally to be able to access the routes let's set up our `urlpatterns` in `api/urls.py`:

	from django.urls import path, include

	from .views import TipList, TipDetail

	urlpatterns = [
		path('', TipList.as_view()),
		path('<int:pk>', TipDetail.as_view()),
		path('admin/', include('rest_framework.urls')),
	]

And in the main app's router file (`tips/urls.py`) include the `api` one like this:

	from django.urls import path, include

	urlpatterns = [
		path(r'api/', include('api.urls')),
	]

And that's it! Let's launch the server and check out our new API next ...

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ python manage.py runserver
	...
	Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Verify it works

We can consume our API with various tools:

### `curl`

Nice and easy:

	[bobbelderbos@imac ~]$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/4
	{"tip":"Q: difference between __str__ and __repr__ in #Python? A: \"My rule of thumb:  __repr__ is for developers, __str__ is for customers.\" (Ned Batchelder on SO)","code":null,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/1438297","user":1,"approved":true,"share_link":null}

### Postman

_Postman Simplifies API Development_. You can download it [here](https://www.getpostman.com/).

Get all tips:

![get all tips]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/postman-get-all.png)

Get a single tip:

![get single tip]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/postman-get-one.png)

Verify I cannot post without login:

![cannot post]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/postman-post.png)

### Django REST Framework

Django REST provides a really nice browser interface to play with our new API:

![Django rest front-end]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/django-rest-browser1.png)

As I am an _anonymous_ user I don't see any edit options:

![Django rest front-end]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/django-rest-browser2.png)

When I log in as my _superuser_ though, a form and delete button show up:

![Django rest front-end]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/django-rest-browser3.png)

Navigating back to the root of the API, I can also `POST` a new tip now that I am logged in:

![Django rest front-end]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/django-rest-browser4.png)

### Tests

Ideally we'd write some tests at this point to future-proof any changes we have to make to our API. I leave that as an exercise (challenge) for the reader though. You can PR your code for this challenge [here](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/39/). We did a similar exercise [here](https://pybit.es/simple-flask-api.html).

---

## Deploy the API to Digital Ocean

I got 100 bucks credit for free via [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/) - nice, thanks!

### Fresh install

My first attempt (cause _programmers are supposed to be lazy_, right?!) was to go with the [Django One-Click Application](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/django/):

![Django droplet]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/django-droplet1.png)

![Django droplet]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/django-droplet2.png)

However the [latest Django from APT](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/python-django) is 1.11 at this time and our API uses Django 2.x so let's set everything up from scratch using a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 server instance. Not only do we get it exactly as we want, it's also a nice learning exercise!

![new Ubuntu instance]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/ubuntu1804.png)

### SSH access and keys

First hurdle you might find is not being able to SSH in as root (I should have remembered this from my old SunOS days ...):

	$ ssh root@159.203.186.209
	root@159.203.186.209: Permission denied (publickey).

`PermitRootLogin` was already set to `yes` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, but I also had to set `PasswordAuthentication` to `yes` opening a Console session from Digital Ocean's BUI, followed by a `sudo service ssh restart`. Now I was able to SSH in as root.

I [uploaded a SSH public key](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/to-account/) to Digital Ocean's account page and had it added to the droplet upon creaton. This populated `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with my public key.

Locally I then made an alias in `.ssh/config` to be able to login using the alias `ssh dioc`:

	Host dioc
	HostName 159.203.186.209
	User root
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/DO

(Where `/.ssh/DO` is my private key stored locally.)

### Upgrade

Best practice is to first upgrade the OS because it was behind on important security fixes. This required a reboot:

	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade
	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# reboot

Logging in again I followed Digital Ocean's [Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04) creating a user: `adduser bob` and granting `sudo` rights: `usermod -aG sudo bob`

### Firewall

Next I enabled the firewall:

	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# ufw app list
	Available applications:
	OpenSSH
	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# ufw allow OpenSSH
	Rules updated
	Rules updated (v6)
	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# ufw enable
	Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
	Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# ufw status
	Status: active

	To                         Action      From
	--                         ------      ----
	OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
	OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

### SSH part II

Next I made sure my new user (`bob`) could login as well.

As I use SSH keys for logging in as root, I copied over the `.ssh` folder to my new user's home folder using `rsync`:

	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# rsync --archive --chown=bob:bob ~/.ssh /home/bob
	root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~# ls -l  /home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys
	-rw------- 1 bob bob 410 Mar  3 07:40 /home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys

And locally I made a new SSH shortcut in `.ssh/config`:

	Host diocu
	HostName 159.203.186.209
	User bob
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/DO

At this point `bob` could SSH in using the alias `ssh diocu`:

	(venv) [bobbelderbos@imac tips_api (master)]$ ssh diocu
	Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-45-generic x86_64)
	...
	To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
	See "man sudo_root" for details.

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~$

Next I followed Digital Ocean's useful article: [How To Set Up Django with Postgres, Nginx, and Gunicorn on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04).

This guide shows you how to install Django within a virtual environment which I think is the best way to go, _Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!_ (Zen of Python)

What follows is mostly the same as the steps outlined in that guide, but through the lens of me doing it for our API. 

### Python 3

First we need to install the following packages, upgrade `pip` and grab `virtualenv`. Note I logged in as `bob` so any _admin_ commands need to be preceded by `sudo`:

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx curl
	sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
	sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv

### Database

We want to use a postgres DB and user:

	sudo -u postgres psql
	postgres=# CREATE DATABASE tips;
	CREATE DATABASE
	postgres=# CREATE USER pybites WITH PASSWORD 'something-secure';
	CREATE ROLE
	postgres=# ALTER ROLE pybites SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
	ALTER ROLE
	postgres=# ALTER ROLE pybites SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
	ALTER ROLE
	postgres=# ALTER ROLE pybites SET timezone TO 'UTC';
	ALTER ROLE
	postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tips TO pybites;
	GRANT
	postgres=# \q

### Pull in the Django API code

Not part of the guide, but at this point I pulled in our code from Github saving it to my `$HOME` folder:

	git clone https://github.com/pybites/tips_api
	cd tips_api

### Settings

I added this to the venv's activation script, to run the dev server (`gunicorn` won't use these though as we will see in a bit):

	$ vi venv/bin/activate
	...
	export SECRET_KEY='xyz'
	export DEBUG=True
	export ALLOWED_HOSTS='localhost, 159.203.186.209'
	export DB_ENGINE='django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2'
	export DB_NAME='tips'
	export DB_USER='pybites'
	export DB_PASSWORD='something-secure'

	$ source venv/bin/activate

These are referenced in Django's `tips/settings.py` with sensible defaults if omitted:

	ALLOWED_HOSTS = os.environ.get('ALLOWED_HOSTS', 'localhost').split(', ')
	...
	DATABASES = {
		'default': {
			'ENGINE': os.environ.get('DB_ENGINE', 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'),  # default sqlite3 if desired
			'NAME': os.environ.get('DB_NAME', os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')),
			'USER': os.environ.get('DB_USER', ''),
			'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD', ''),
			'HOST': os.environ.get('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
			'PORT': os.environ.get('DB_PORT', ''),  # can leave empty on Digital Ocean
		}
	}

### Dependencies

With my venv enabled let's install the dependencies:

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ pip install -r requirements.txt
	...
	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ pip freeze
	beautifulsoup4==4.7.1
	bs4==0.0.1
	certifi==2018.11.29
	chardet==3.0.4
	Django==2.1.7
	djangorestframework==3.9.1
	gunicorn==19.9.0
	idna==2.8
	psycopg2==2.7.7
	psycopg2-binary==2.7.7
	pytz==2018.9
	requests==2.21.0
	soupsieve==1.8
	urllib3==1.24.1

### Static files

To support static file handling by Nginx we need to set the following two constants in `tips/settings.py`:

	STATIC_URL = '/static/'
	STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')

### Sync the DB

Next we sync the models/migrations to the newly created postgres DB:

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ python manage.py migrate
	Operations to perform:
	Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions, tips
	Running migrations:
	Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
	Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
	Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
	Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
	Applying admin.0003_logentry_add_action_flag_choices... OK
	Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
	Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
	Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
	Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
	Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
	Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
	Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
	Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
	Applying auth.0009_alter_user_last_name_max_length... OK
	Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK
	Applying tips.0001_initial... OK
	Applying tips.0002_auto_20190302_1958... OK
	Applying tips.0003_auto_20190302_2011... OK

Great!

Note that Django migrations are committed to source code so I did not have to generate them (`makemigrations`) again!

### Superuser

Let's create our `pybites` admin to pull in our existing tips:

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ python manage.py createsuperuser
	Username (leave blank to use 'bob'): pybites
	Email address:
	Password:
	Password (again):
	Superuser created successfully.

And import the tips from our platform:

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ python manage.py sync_tips
	Done: 92 tips imported

Perfect. Let's collect the static files (_but it's an API?_ you might ask ... well, Django's Admin back-end and Django REST Framework's browser UI use quite a few static files!)

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ python manage.py collectstatic
	155 static files copied to '/home/bob/tips_api/static'.

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ ls static/
	admin  rest_framework

### Dev server

To run the development server have the firewall grant access to port 8000:

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo ufw allow 8000
	[sudo] password for bob:
	Rule added
	Rule added (v6)

And now we can run the development server: 

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
	Performing system checks...

	System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
	March 04, 2019 - 09:05:00
	Django version 2.1.7, using settings 'tips.settings'
	Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
	Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

Browsing to `http://159.203.186.209:8000/api/` we see:

![api from dev server]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/remote-api-dev-server.png)

Awesome! Well, actually first I got a permission error because I only had _localhost_ in `ALLOWED_HOSTS` so make sure you add your own IP. Again in this case that is `159.203.186.209`.

### Gunicorn

Now let's use Gunicorn. First test it manually:

	(venv) bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 tips.wsgi
	[2019-03-04 09:11:10 +0000] [16579] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.9.0
	[2019-03-04 09:11:10 +0000] [16579] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (16579)
	[2019-03-04 09:11:10 +0000] [16579] [INFO] Using worker: sync
	[2019-03-04 09:11:10 +0000] [16582] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 16582

Next we make it persistent with a _socket_:

> The Gunicorn socket will be created at boot and will listen for connections. When a connection occurs, systemd will automatically start the Gunicorn process to handle the connection.

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket

Add this:

	[Unit]
	Description=gunicorn socket

	[Socket]
	ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock

	[Install]
	WantedBy=sockets.target

Then create a `gunicorn.service`:

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service

Adding:

	[Unit]
	Description=gunicorn daemon
	Requires=gunicorn.socket
	After=network.target

	[Service]
	User=bob
	Group=www-data
	WorkingDirectory=/home/bob/tips_api
	ExecStart=/home/bob/tips_api/venv/bin/gunicorn \
			-e SECRET_KEY='abc' \
			-e DEBUG=True \
			-e ALLOWED_HOSTS='localhost, 159.203.186.209' \
			-e DB_ENGINE='django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2' \
			-e DB_NAME='tips' \
			-e DB_USER='pybites' \
			-e DB_PASSWORD='abc' \
			--access-logfile - \
			--workers 3 \
			--bind unix:/run/gunicorn.sock \
			tips.wsgi:application

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target

And here I had some trouble: Gunicorn did not pick up env variables so Django would not get its required `SECRET_KEY` etc.

As per [this thread](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/gunicorn-service-can-t-read-environment-variables) I tried `EnvironmentFile=/home/bob/.env` copying the variables from `venv/bin/activate` (argh). Even that did not work.

So I ended up with adding them with multiple `-e` flags making it less DRY, although as all runs through `gunicorn` we might just ditch them from `venv/bin/activate` altogether.

To set this in motion:

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket
	Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/gunicorn.socket → /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket.

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket
	Failed to dump process list, ignoring: No such file or directory
	● gunicorn.socket - gunicorn socket
	Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
	Active: active (listening) since Mon 2019-03-04 09:18:06 UTC; 21s ago
	Listen: /run/gunicorn.sock (Stream)
	CGroup: /system.slice/gunicorn.socket

	Mar 04 09:18:06 ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01 systemd[1]: Listening on gunicorn socket.

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ file /run/gunicorn.sock
	/run/gunicorn.sock: socket

By the way, when troubleshooting these kind of issues and when making changes to your `gunicorn` config, remember to restart both the `daemon` and the `gunicorn` service:

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart gunicorn.socket gunicorn.service

### Nginx

As per [Digital Ocean's guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04) I needed to do the following to get Nginx running:

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/tips_api

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name 159.203.186.209;

		location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
		location /static/ {
			root /home/bob/tips_api;
		}

		location / {
			include proxy_params;
			proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
		}
	}

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/tips_api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo nginx -t
	nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
	nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo ufw delete allow 8000
	Rule deleted
	Rule deleted (v6)
	bob@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01:~/tips_api$ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
	Rule added
	Rule added (v6) 

I ran into a weird error after this:

	Mar 04 10:06:18 ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc1-01 systemd[1]: nginx.service: Failed to parse PID from file /run/nginx.pid: Invalid argument

... which I could resolve using [this workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42084804), but it was overshadowed by the Gunicorn ENV variable issue I described earlier, so not sure if this would have been a stopper.

And voilà: we have our PyBites API hosted on Digital Ocean!

![API on Digital Ocean]({filename}/images/django-rest-digital-ocean/remote-api-dev-server.png)

## Conclusion

This was a fun exercise! We managed to turn PyBites Tips into its own service hosted in the cloud!

The only challenge was `gunicorn` not picking up environment variables from a file, but we got around that and it all works nicely now ...

Now go build your own API with the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and [PR us your code here](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/34/).

I will do a follow-up article on how to use the Slack API and its [Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) feature to `POST` tips to this API from our Slack. 

By the way, PyBites Slack is a really cool place to hang out, you can join us [here](https://join.slack.com/t/pybites/shared_invite/enQtNDAxODc0MjEyODM2LTNiZjljNTI2NGJiNWI0MTRkNjY4YzQ1ZWU4MmQzNWQyN2Q4ZTQzMTk0NzkyZTRmMThlNmQzYTk5Y2Y5ZDM4NDU).
