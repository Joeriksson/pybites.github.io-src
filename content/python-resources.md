In this article a list of useful Python resources to boost up your skills. It goes without saying that the best way to get better in Python is to read and write a lot of code. However these resources can definitely help fill in the knowledge gaps.

## To get started

* [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/): official, quick-start tour to the language, introduces the standard library.

* [Head first Python, 2nd ed](http://amzn.to/2lVnTJP): detailed explanation of the language, lot of practical examples and as head first provides a lot of visual aid.

* Jessica McKellar's [Introduction to Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000448.do) and [Intermediate Python Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049852.do) are awesome. I recommended these videos to a new Pythonista at work and he already thanked me: clear, concise, fun and practical examples, for him the concepts really started to make sense watching these videos.

* Michael Kennedy has [a growing set of awesome trainings](https://training.talkpython.fm/): [Write Pythonic Code Like a Seasoned Developer](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_pythonic_code/write-pythonic-code-like-a-seasoned-developer) teaches you a lot of Python features and more importantly how to write Pythonic code. See [our review](http://pybit.es/pythonic-code-course-rewiew.html), for us it's kind of the manual we wish we'd had when we started! To learn by building cool projects, check out his [Python Jumpstart by Building 10 Apps](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_python_jumpstart/python-language-jumpstart-building-10-apps). 

* [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/): this is another excellent introduction.

* If you want to learn by practical projects, take a look at [Automate the boring stuff](http://amzn.to/2lxrPiK) which we reviewed [here](http://pybit.es/automate_the_boring_stuff_review.html), the author also has [a free tutorial on games](https://inventwithpython.com/)

* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://amzn.to/2lV8rgL) takes another approach by having your hands at the keyboard, working through progressively more difficult code examples.

## Fundamentals done, get better

* [The Hitchhiker's guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/): this is a great work, it teaches Python best practices, comunnity tools, and is quite unique in that it teaches by looking at the source code of top-notch open source projects.

* [Fluent Python](http://amzn.to/2lxsmBg): on to become a classic. This is one of the best Python books out there. This gem has so much knowledge, best practices, and deep understanding of Python embedded. I read it last summer (somebody at PyData recommended it to me) and it is THE book that got me to the next level.

* [Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](http://amzn.to/2lxsIba): I like the effective series for its recipe format. Very knowledgeable author, this book teaches you how to write Pythonic code.

* [Core Python Applications Programming](http://amzn.to/2lxxiq1): teaches concepts through real-world applications. Lot of code, covers a lot: Google App Engine, APIs, Database / web programming, even MS office programming.

* [The hacker's guide to Python](https://thehackerguidetopython.com/): I bought this ebook last week after being impressed reading the free functional programming chapter, not done yet, but already found some great insights, not easily found in other resources.

* [Powerful Python](https://powerfulpython.com/): good tutorial on advanced concepts like decorators, OOP design patterns, automated testing. The accompanying video shows you how to make a RESTful API using TDD, very interesting / useful.

* Two Packt books that I read parts of and explain more advanced topics very well: [Mastering Python](http://amzn.to/2lVphMx) and [Expert Python Programming, 2nd ed](http://amzn.to/2lxLQ91). 

* For reference works check out [Python cookbook](http://amzn.to/2lxIB18) and [Python in a nutshell](http://amzn.to/2mcgKHs).

## Other resources

* If you learn better by video checkout [PyVideo](http://pyvideo.org/), I also found it very useful to watch PyCon talks, see [this PyCon 2016 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwTD5zJbsQGJN75MwbykYNw) for example. 

* [Dan Bader's blog](https://dbader.org/), his new book: [Python tricks](https://dbader.org/products/python-tricks-book/) reviewed [here](http://pybit.es/pytricks-review.html). He also made a useful [list of Python podcasts](https://dbader.org/blog/ultimate-list-of-python-podcasts).

* On the subject of podcasts, Michael Kennedy's [Talk Python To Me](https://talkpython.fm) is a must-listen for any Python developer. For headlines tune into [Python Bytes](https://pythonbytes.fm/), a nice weekly digest of Python news.

* Testing is important, and Python has great coverage: unittest, pytest, nose, doctest ... get started [here](http://pythontesting.net/start-here/) or listen to Brian Okken's [Test and Code podcast](http://testandcode.com).

* For an understanding of algorithms I recommend [Grokking algorithms](http://amzn.to/2lxGLNP) we detailed [here](http://pybit.es/grokking_algorithms.html). Another resource is [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

* If you want to learn Flask and Django, and Python web development and database programming in general, check out [Real Python's great courses](https://realpython.com). 

* If you want to use Microsoft Excel as a user friendly front-end to your Python code, check out [pyxll](http://www.pyxll.com/blog/).

* [Awesome Python](https://awesome-python.com/) - a curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources (discussed [here](http://pybit.es/awesome_python_resources.html)).

* [Python progression path - From apprentice to guru SO thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573135/python-progression-path-from-apprentice-to-guru) contains some useful advice as well.

* Guido's [King's Day Speech](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com.es/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html) as well as [his essays](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/) (I read [one about optimization](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/list2str/) today, awesome!).

## Lists from other Pythonistas

* The mentioned Hitchhiker's guide has [a good resources list](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/).

* Full Stack Python's [Best Python Resources](https://www.fullstackpython.com/best-python-resources.html).

* Pixelmonkey's article: [The 3 Best Python Books for Your Team](http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2015/06/06/pybooks).

## Pff ...

I know what you are saying, and I had the same feeling writing this article: there are just too many resources. Again, writing code is the best way to get better so the best advice I can give you is to pick up one of the resources, read some, start coding. Read some more, try new things you learn in your code. Repeat.

	>>> import itertools
	>>> import time
	>>> for action in itertools.cycle(['read some more', 'code some more']):
	...   print(action)
	...   time.sleep(1)
	...
	read some more
	code some more
	read some more
	code some more

I hope this list is useful. Feel free to use the comments below to share other resources that made you a better Python programmer.

## Update: additions after Reddit

Wow amazed at the amount of upvotes / comments [on Reddit](https://redd.it/5sjt3l), thanks for your support. I am adding some suggestions made in the commens: 

* Youtube channel: [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex), lot of good Python learning, Django was specially mentioned.

* For Data Science I heard good things about [Python Data Science Handbook](http://amzn.to/2lVnp6j) which shares all Jupyter notebooks freely [here](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook). See also [this new thread](https://redd.it/5som5b) with cheat sheets for Python for data science.

* I replied another question about web scraping [with some resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/5sjt3l/from_beginner_to_pro_python_books_videos_and/ddh6ski/).

* [MIT intro computer science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9) was labeled as very tough for a beginner. I read some of [Allen Downey's work](http://greenteapress.com/wp/) sometime ago which I liked.
