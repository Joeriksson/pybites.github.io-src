Hey Pythonistas, in this challenge you will expand on the work of PCC58, doing some natural language processing (NLP) on the podcast transcript data you collected. Have fun!

## The Challenge

Here are the steps you would follow:

- Run your script of [PCC58](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/58/) to have the data ready in your project folder. If you have not done this and you want to work on the [Talk Python To Me podcast](https://talkpython.fm/) [transcripts](https://github.com/mikeckennedy/talk-python-transcripts/tree/master/transcripts), you can use one of the PR'd scripts [here](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/tree/community/58).
- Make a virtual environment and `pip install nltk` = [NLTK / Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org).
- Read up on how to use the library. You can read [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/) for free online, isn't that awesome?
- From here on we leave you totally free to find the patterns in the data that you are interested in: sentiments, book recommendations, you name it.
- Show the results any way you like. We are new to the library ourselves, but we love [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for their exploratory nature!
- PR your work via our platform. If you are reading this on our blog use [this link](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/59).

Good luck and have fun!

## Ideas and feedback

If you have ideas for a future challenge or find any issues, open a [GH Issue](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues) or reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pybites), [Slack](https://codechalleng.es/settings/) or [Email](mailto:support@pybit.es).

Last but not least: there is no best solution, only learning more and better Python. Good luck!
